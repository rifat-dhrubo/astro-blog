Hi there

I am working with shapes and colours for the last 6 years transforming ideas to pixels and concepts to visuals., I love clarity and simplicity, so working with words is my natural medium. Though I started fire by coding in my early days of career, I used to do Front-end design for websites.

I was always fascinated by people - their minds, behaviour, Interactions from childhood to professionalism. I love building new things with the latest and greatest technology, leveraging my experience to build products that are easy for our users to understand. While I enjoy finding ways to make life easier for people.

My knowledge-seeking personality basically made me inspire to start writing articles . It's like refreshing my knowledge, discovering missing points, and then assembling altogether. I'm pretty much loving this experience!
