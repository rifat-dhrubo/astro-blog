      I tried several times to create case studies and failed. Tried to find out
      what I was lacking and got depressed over time. I tried again to follow
      Dribble and Bahnace for inspirations. I got more frustated. Somewhere I
      felt like people are faking so much to survive or grab the attention for
      recruiters. It is actually a problem since I found out my way of Micro
      case studies. My Goal is simple. Write whatever challenges I took and what
      did not work out for me. I hope you will enjoy the read.
